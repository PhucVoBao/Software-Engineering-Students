## Storage Model

The demo uses `data/db.json` as a lightweight local database. It stores:

- `users`: account records and password hashes.
- `sessions`: bearer tokens with expiration.
- `studentStates`: profile, skills, roadmap progress, chat history, portfolio, bookmarks, mentor sessions, and notes.
- `marketScans`: simulated job portal scan snapshots.

This keeps the demo easy to run for a classroom report while still matching the backend responsibilities in the topic requirements.
